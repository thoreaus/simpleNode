A series of web server examples

simplest - http.js

a bit more complex - express.js

adding ejs templating - ejs_example.js

adding mysql access - sql_ejs_example.js

for all of them, the setup is the same:

clone them onto your server (which must have nodejs and npm installed. Tested with nodejs v6.10.0 and npm 3.10.10 but should be fine with others.)

from the root of the project: npm installed

then "node http.js" or whichever one you want to view.

For the untangling class - make sure that you have forked into your own project and edited the port numbers to those in the email you received.
